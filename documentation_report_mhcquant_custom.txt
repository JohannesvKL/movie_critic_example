ðŸ“„ main.nf (NEXTFLOW)
----------------------------------------
ðŸ“Š Individual Score: 7.0/10

Quality Analysis:
ANALYSIS:

This Nextflow pipeline script appears well-structured and follows nf-core conventions. It includes clear sections for imports, named workflows, and the main workflow.

1.  **Parameter Documentation:** The script itself doesn't contain explicit parameter documentation. It relies on `params.version`, `params.validate_params`, `params.monochrome_logs`, `params.outdir`, `params.input`, `params.email`, `params.email_on_fail`, `params.plaintext_email`, and `params.hook_url` but their purpose and expected values aren't detailed within this file. The pipeline likely uses a separate `nextflow.config` file for parameter definitions.

2.  **Parameter Types:** Parameter types are not explicitly specified within the script.  The types are inferred based on usage, but this is not ideal for clarity.  For instance, `params.validate_params` is likely a boolean, but this isn't explicitly stated.

3.  **Default Values:** Default values are not visible in this file. These are likely defined in `nextflow.config` or similar configuration files.

4.  **Required vs. Optional Parameters:** Required and optional parameters aren't marked within this file. The presence of `--input` and `--fasta` flags suggests these are required, but this isn't enforced in this file.

5.  **Usage Information:** Usage information is absent from the script itself. The initial comments provide links to the project's GitHub and website, which should contain usage details.

6.  **Inconsistencies and Errors:** The script appears logically consistent. The `PIPELINE_INITIALISATION` subworkflow seems to be correctly used to prepare input channels for the main `NFCORE_MHCQUANT` workflow.  The `PIPELINE_COMPLETION` subworkflow handles post-processing and notification. The workflow structure including the use of `take:` and `emit:` looks correct. The script includes the `args` object in the `PIPELINE_INITIALISATION` subworkflow which is good practice.

ðŸ“„ nextflow.config (CONFIG)
----------------------------------------
ðŸ“Š Individual Score: 7.0/10

Quality Analysis:
ANALYSIS:

This Nextflow configuration file appears well-structured and comprehensive, typical of nf-core pipelines.

*   **Documentation:** While the introductory comments provide a general overview, the individual parameters lack detailed, in-line documentation. There are no comments explaining the purpose of each parameter or the rationale behind its default value. The exception is the initial block comment that introduces the file.

*   **Default Values:** The default values seem reasonable for many parameters. However, without explicit explanations, it's difficult to assess the appropriateness of all defaults. For example, the `quantification_mz_window = 5` parameter has no context regarding its unit (ppm, Da, etc.) or why 5 is the default. The `default_params_file_comet = ' '` is also unusual and begs the question if an empty string would be better or if it is intended to represent no default file.

*   **Comments:** The configuration lacks comments explaining complex configurations. For example, the interaction between `feature_generators = 'deeplc,ms2pip'` and the other `deeplc` and `ms2pip` related parameters is not clearly explained. The purpose of `spectrum_batch_size = 0` could be better understood with a comment.

*   **Structure and Organization:** The structure is logical, grouping parameters by functionality (input options, workflow options, Comet search parameters, etc.). This enhances readability. The use of profiles for different execution environments is also standard practice.

*   **Deprecated/Incorrect Configurations:** I don't see any immediately obvious deprecated or incorrect configurations. The date formatting for `trace_report_suffix` is a functional approach. The use of URLs for custom config versions is also fine. The configuration options for different containerisation technologies appear to be mutually exclusive as expected.

SCORE: 7/10

ðŸ“„ conf/base.config (CONFIG)
----------------------------------------
ðŸ“Š Individual Score: 7.0/10

Quality Analysis:
ANALYSIS:

This Nextflow configuration file appears to be a reasonable base configuration for the `nf-core/mhcquant` pipeline. It focuses on resource allocation and error handling.

1.  **Documentation:** The initial comment block provides a good overview of the file's purpose and intended environment. However, detailed documentation of each specific configuration option (e.g., the meaning of `errorStrategy` values or the logic behind retry attempts) is missing.

2.  **Default Values:** The default CPU, memory, and time values seem like a reasonable starting point for general tasks. The multiplier `task.attempt` for retries is a good practice.

3.  **Comments:** The comments are generally clear, especially regarding the use of process labels for resource allocation.

4.  **Structure:** The configuration is logically structured using `process` scope and `withLabel` selectors for defining resource profiles for different task types. The use of labels like `process_single`, `process_low`, `process_medium`, `process_high`, `process_long`, and `process_high_memory` provides a good abstraction for categorizing processes.

5.  **Correctness:** The `errorStrategy` uses a range `(130..145) + 104` which includes exit codes related to out-of-memory errors and other potential issues. The use of `-1` for `maxErrors` is appropriate for allowing unlimited errors.

The `withName:TDF2MZML` config block duplicates the task.attempt with a string, which is invalid syntax. This is an error.

ðŸ“„ README.md (README)
----------------------------------------
ðŸ“Š Individual Score: 7.0/10

Quality Analysis:
ANALYSIS:
The README provides a good initial overview of the nf-core/mhcquant pipeline.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Introduction:** The introduction clearly states the purpose of the pipeline and its relevance to immunopeptidomics research.
*   **Visual Aids:** The logo and pipeline overview diagram (subway map) are helpful.
*   **Badges:** The badges provide quick access to information about the pipeline's status (CI, linting), dependencies (Nextflow, Conda, Docker, Singularity), citation (Zenodo), and community channels (Slack, Twitter, Mastodon, YouTube).
*   **Usage Example:** A basic usage example with a sample sheet is provided, which is a good starting point for users.
*   **Technology Stack:** Clearly states that the pipeline uses Nextflow, Docker/Singularity and DSL2.
*   **nf-core Compliant:** The README follows nf-core guidelines, including links to nf-core modules and website.
*   **AWS CI:** Mentions automated testing on AWS and links to results.

**Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Installation:** The installation process is not detailed within the README itself. It refers to an external nf-core documentation page.
*   **Parameter Documentation:** The README references external documentation for usage and parameters, but the snippet provided doesn't include the full parameter documentation. It's cut off abruptly.
*   **Troubleshooting:** There is no explicit troubleshooting information provided in the snippet.
*   **Dependencies:** While dependencies like Nextflow, Conda, Docker, and Singularity are mentioned, the specific versions or detailed software dependencies within the pipeline are not listed.
*   **Completeness:** The provided snippet ends abruptly, suggesting that the full README is not available. This makes it difficult to assess the completeness of the documentation.

The reliance on external documentation (nf-core website) is both a strength (consistency with nf-core standards) and a weakness (information is not immediately available in the README). Given the information available, the README provides a reasonable starting point, but its completeness is limited by the reliance on external links for crucial information.

ðŸ“„ docs/usage.md (README)
----------------------------------------
ðŸ“Š Individual Score: 7.0/10

Quality Analysis:
ANALYSIS:
The README file provides usage instructions for the nf-core/mhcquant pipeline, primarily focusing on input samplesheet creation and recommended search settings.

1.  **Installation:** The installation process is not described within this README. The documentation directs users to the nf-core website.
2.  **Usage Examples:** A samplesheet example is provided and appears to be well-formatted and informative. The command-line argument for the input samplesheet is also given.
3.  **Parameters and Options:** The README mentions that parameter documentation is available on the nf-core website and via the `--help` flag. Specific parameters relating to MS search are discussed in detail.
4.  **Troubleshooting:** The README doesn't contain a dedicated troubleshooting section.
5.  **Dependencies and Requirements:** Dependencies are not explicitly listed. The document mentions the use of OpenMS and MSÂ²Rescore, which implicitly suggests these as dependencies.
6.  **Up-to-date and Accurate:** The documentation seems reasonably up-to-date, referencing features like MSÂ²Rescore and directing users to external resources like the nf-core website and GitHub repositories for specific tools. The warning at the beginning indicates that documentation has migrated to nf-core.

The heavy reliance on the nf-core website for comprehensive documentation is both a strength (centralized documentation) and a weakness (less self-contained documentation). The inclusion of an external wiki (nf-core website) is beneficial.
